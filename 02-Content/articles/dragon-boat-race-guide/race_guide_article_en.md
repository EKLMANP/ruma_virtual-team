## 🎒 Pre-Race Prep: Gear Checklist {#gear}

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/B2ZNfjfB/image.png" alt="Dragon Boat Gear Checklist" border="0">

Race day is usually chaotic. Instead of scrambling to find things in the morning, pack your bag the night before.

### Essentials (No ID, No Race!)
1.  **ID Card**: ID card, Health Insurance Card, or Passport (Originals!). Staff will strictly check these at check-in. **No ID = No Boarding**, and that is the ultimate rookie mistake.
2.  **Water Bottle**: Race venues are usually hot. Staying hydrated is key to survival.
3.  **Spare Clothes**: You **will** get wet, whether from splashing or sweat. Bring a clean set of clothes and a towel.
4.  **Sun Protection**: Hat, sunglasses, sunscreen. The water reflection is strong; if you don't want to turn into a piece of charcoal, apply generously.

### Highly Recommended
*   **Butt Pad**: Dragon boat benches vary in hardness, and with long waiting times, a waterproof seat pad can be your butt's savior.
*   **Slippers/Water Shoes**: Some venues require wading into water to board, or the docks can be scorching hot.
*   **Personal Meds**: Motion sickness pills (if you're sensitive), painkillers, muscle spray, etc.
*   **Raincoat**: Weather is unpredictable; better safe than sorry.

> 💡 **RUMA Coach Tip:** Try to bring minimal valuables (wallet, phone) or leave them with non-racing friends. The boat is cramped and... **it really gets wet**.

## 🥣 Pre-Race Nutrition: Fuel for the Race {#nutrition}

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/d4XjGwBJ/image.png" alt="Pre-Race Nutrition" border="0">

Dragon boat racing is high-intensity interval training. Eating right gives you explosive power; eating wrong might make you want to throw up halfway through.

### 2-3 Days Before
*   **Hydrate**: Pre-hydrate your body; don't wait until you're thirsty.
*   **Carb Loading**: Slightly increase carbohydrate intake (rice, noodles, sweet potatoes) to store energy in your muscles.

### Race Day Breakfast
*   **Easy to Digest**: Toast, steamed buns, bananas, oatmeal.
*   **Avoid**: Greasy food (fried dough sticks, rice balls), high fiber (raw salads), dairy (if you're lactose intolerant).
*   **Timing**: Finish eating 2 hours before the race to give your stomach time to digest.

### Between Races
*   **Small Meals**: If you get hungry between two races, grab an energy bar, banana, or energy jelly for quick absorption. Don't eat a big meal!

## 🏁 Race Day: Schedule & What to Expect {#race-day}

Most race schedules are similar, usually following this flow:

### 1. Check-in (Approx. 30-60 mins before race)

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/jPTnwpn9/image.jpg" alt="Check-in" border="0">

*   Gather when the captain calls.
*   Take your **ID** to the check-in counter. Staff will verify your face and ID.
*   After check-in, you'll usually get a stamp or wristband. **Do not wander off**; the team needs to move to the dock together.

### 2. Warm-up & Assembly
*   Dynamic warm-up on land to open up your joints.
*   Put on your life jacket (buckle it tight!).
*   Grab your paddle and prepare to board.

### 3. Boarding
*   **Follow Commands**: Usually, those who can stabilize the boat (or as instructed by staff) board first. Don't rush all at once; the boat will rock.
*   Once seated, plant your feet and rest your paddle flat.

### 4. Head to Start & Signals
This is the most nerve-wracking part!
*   **Alignment**: The referee will shout to adjust the boat's position (Paddle forward a bit, paddle back a bit).
*   **Are You Ready?**: Drummer watches this! If there are no issues, don't raise your hand (or raise to signal readiness, depending on the rules).
*   **Attention! / Prêt!**: This is "Set". Paddles buried in the water, fully focused, body tense and ready.
*   **Gunshot/Horn**: **GO!**

### 5. The Race
*   **Eyes Front**: Stare at the **Stroke's (First Row)** paddle, or the back of the teammate in front of you. **NEVER look at the opponent!** Looking sideways distracts you and breaks rhythm.
*   **Listen to the Drum**: The drummer is the heart. Paddle to the beat of the drum.
*   **Don't Stop**: Even if your arms feel like they're falling off, keep "shadow paddling" (moving with the rhythm). You absolutely cannot stop, or your paddle becomes a water brake.

## 😱 Common Rookie Mistakes & Fixes {#common-mistakes}

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7d3BTgBj/image.jpg" alt="Common Rookie Mistakes" border="0">

### 1. False Start
*   **Situation**: Too nervous, accidentally pulling before the gun.
*   **Fix**: Deep breath, focus on the sound, don't anticipate. Two false starts usually disqualify the whole team.

### 2. Dropping the Paddle
*   **Situation**: Slippery hands or clashing with the person next to you, sending the paddle flying.
*   **Fix**: If you drop it, **do not reach for it** (dangerous!). If you have a spare paddle, grab it. If not... paddle with your hands (just kidding, stay low and don't block the person behind you, keep your balance).

### 3. Hero Ball (Trying to be the Hero)
*   **Situation**: Trying to paddle harder and faster than everyone else.
*   **Fix**: Dragon boat is **Synchronization > Power**. One person paddling super fast (breaking rhythm) actually slows the boat down. Be a cog in the machine.

### 4. Giving Up (The Most Important One)
*   **Situation**: Last 100m, arms are dying, want to rest for a split second.
*   **Fix**: Grit your teeth! Think about everyone else suffering with you. If you stop, it's like slamming the brakes underwater. Scream it out (internally or follow the chants), cross the finish line and you're a hero!

## FAQ {#faq}


<details>
<summary><strong>Q1: Can I race if I can't swim?</strong></summary>

Most races require you to **wear a life jacket**, so even if you fall in, you'll be safe. However, if you have a severe fear of water, it might affect your performance. We suggest getting used to the water before the race.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q2: What if it rains on race day?</strong></summary>

Dragon boat is a water sport, **rain or shine**! Unless there's lightning or a typhoon warning, the race goes on. Getting soaked is standard, enjoy the adrenaline in the rain!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q3: What if I need the toilet after boarding?</strong></summary>

**Big No-No!** Once you check in and board, you usually have to wait until after the race to hit the restroom (approx. 30-50 mins). Please empty your tank **before check-in**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q4: Will I get yelled at for paddling slow?</strong></summary>

As long as you **try your best** and **keep the rhythm**, no one will blame you. The worst is "random paddling" which breaks the whole boat's rhythm. As a rookie, it's better to paddle lighter but stay perfectly on beat.

</details>
